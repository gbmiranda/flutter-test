> Truth can only be found in one place: the code. <br/>
> -- Robert C. Martin

## 1. Introduction

This test is intended for candidates applying to Mobile Engineering positions.

We are really excited about your participation in our selection process!

At this step, we are going to evaluate your software engineering skills, but don't worry, the project is fairly simple.

You are expected to use all of your experience to create a production-ready application (or close enough). Our evaluation will cover the following aspects:

Overall implementation (accuracy, readability, etc)
Git skills (fragmentation, commit messages, etc)
Documentation (source code, readme file, etc)
Testability (testing framework, coverage, etc)

## 2. Pre-requisites

- Git
- A development environment

You are welcome to use the latests SDKs.

### 2.1. Vacancy specifics

You might be applying for Flutter positions, so the project should be implemented based on the position you are applying.

## 3. Task

Build an app for one platform (Android or iOS) to track weather in a fashion manner for a rock'n'roll band staff.

The band staff needs to track the current weather and the forecast for the 5 next days of the main cities where shows of the tour are taking place:

- Silverstone, UK
- SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil
- Melbourne, Australia
- Monte Carlo, Monaco

## 4. Requirements

The app must contemplate the following requirements:

- Have two screens
- Current weather
- Forecast for the next 5 days
- The concerts list must display the city name and provide a search field in the top (find by city name)
- Must work offline (will be tested with airplane mode)
- Must support multiple resolutions and sizes

### 4.1. Weather retrieval

You must use the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org) API. You can create a [free account](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) and get your [API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).

API documentation:
- https://openweathermap.org/current
- https://openweathermap.org/forecast

## 5. Deliverable

You are expected to submit a doc and compacted git repository with the project through the form you received.

You should focus on app architecture, tests, model design and UI/UX.

Enjoy :)
