-- Robert C. Martin

1. Introduction
This test is intended for candidates applying to Mobile Engineering positions at CloudWalk.

2. Pre-requisites
Git
A development environment
You are welcome to use the latests SDKs.

2.1. Vacancy specifics
You might be applying for Flutter, Android or iOS positions, so the project should be implemented based on the position you are applying.

3. Task

4. Requirements
The app must contemplate the following requirements:

Have two screens
Current weather
Forecast for the next 5 days
The concerts list must display the city name and provide a search field in the top (find by city name)
Must work offline (will be tested with airplane mode)
Must support multiple resolutions and sizes
4.1. Weather retrieval
You must use the OpenWeather API. You can create a free account and get your API key.

5. Deliverable
You are expected to submit a compacted git repository with the project through the form you received.
